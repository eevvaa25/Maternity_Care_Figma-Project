**Designed an optimized emergency induction and Cesarean Section workflow within a maternity EHR system to reduce decision-to-delivery delays and improve interdisciplinary communication during high-risk events.**


### [🏆My Project](https://www.figma.com/proto/ZKd5Yp9XStZQRmH1JRN7Et/Maternity-Department-Workflows?node-id=6034-2322&starting-point-node-id=6034%3A2322)

## 🎯 Research Question


**How can maternity department workflows be redesigned during an EHR system transition to improve patient safety, reduce inefficiencies, and enhance interdisciplinary coordination during time-sensitive obstetric events?**


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Figma 


## 🔍 Key Findings
- Lack of real-time alert escalation delayed interdisciplinary response
- Manual consent documentation introduced critical time gaps
- No standardized preoperative checklist increased variability in preparation
- Role ambiguity between OB, anesthesia, and nursing staff reduced workflow clarity
- Absence of automated protocol activation slowed emergency mobilization

## 💡 Interpretation
- The primary challenges were workflow inefficiencies and communication gaps rather than clinical decision-making itself
- Emergency obstetric workflows require structured digital escalation protocols to minimize preventable delays
- Standardization and real-time visibility significantly improve operational safety

## 🚀 Actionable Insight 
- An optimized EHR workflow incorporating structured alert escalation, automated protocol activation, and digital consent integration can reduce decision-to-delivery time and improve maternal-fetal safety outcomes by:
  - Triggering automated emergency protocol dashboards
  - Sending real-time interdisciplinary notifications
  - Integrating digital consent capture
  - Activating standardized preoperative checklists
 
## ⚠️ Limitations
- Prototype-level design (no live clinical deployment)
- No real-time hospital system integration testing
- Workflow assumptions based on modeled emergency scenarios
- No quantitative time-to-delivery metrics measured
